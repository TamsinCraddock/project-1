            <p>In a perfect world, you'd have all the free time in the world to take your pooch for multiple walks per day. But clearly, life, work, and all of your other responsibilities get in the way of your Dog Walking duties. Even if you're able to take your furry friend for a brisk walk in the morning, by the time you get home, exhausted from a long day, it can be hard to get up the energy to do it all again.</p>

            <p>Exercise is an important part of your dog's day. Happy Tails provides dog walks in multiple options from group walks to one-on-one sessions and our dog walking services can be provided on a set weekly schedule or on an as needed basis.  During a dog walk we come to your home to collect your dog and drop them back home once the walk is completed.  Time can be utilized for a leashed walk, yard play, beach run or any combination.</p>
